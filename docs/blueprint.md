## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) for a sense of focus and reliability. 
- Background color: Very light gray (#F4F5F7), near-white, to keep the focus on the content and provide a clean feel.
- Accent color: Cyan (#26A69A), to add contrast for buttons and highlights. 
- Body text: 'PT Sans', a clean and versatile sans-serif font.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' to contrast with body copy, adding some visual interest and style without being distracting.
- Use clear, minimalist icons from a Material Design set. Icons should support visual understanding, and consistently represent main user actions, but without too much personality to remain neutral.
- Use a card-based layout to present information in a structured and organized manner. Cards should have rounded corners and subtle shadows to create a modern look. Make elements comfortable and provide adequate whitespace for legibility.
